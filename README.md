# NEVER HALFWAY

**"They ask why I didn’t quit. I ask what quitting even looks like."**

## 🔥 Mission

This isn’t a portfolio. This is a manifesto, a toolkit, and a brand built on grit.  
**NEVER HALFWAY** is the personal site and platform of Bill Zade — veteran, builder, musician, coder. It's built to showcase projects, offer services, and share the story behind the work. No templates, no corporate gloss — just tools forged in heat and honed with intent.

## 🧭 Purpose

- Showcase personal projects, code, music, and media
- Provide clear, honest freelance services — web, audio, custom builds
- Create a brand presence for merch, music, and media
- Tell a real story: service, survival, skill, and staying power

## 🎯 Audience

- Developers, indie makers, musicians, veterans
- People who value capability over credentials
- Clients who want honesty, not pitch decks

## 💀 Core Ethos

- **No shortcuts. No fake shine. Never halfway.**
- Every pixel, every line, every sound has a reason.
- Skill over status. Truth over trend.

## 🎨 Visual Identity

Inspired by **Metal Gear Solid HUDs**, **Half-Life UIs**, and **retro terminal gear**, this site embraces:
- **Dark mode only** — tactical, legible, real
- **Charcoal, ember orange, radar green** accents
- **Terminal aesthetics**: scanlines, monospaced fonts, retro overlays
- **Sharp grid layouts**, dossier-style cards, and “tactile” UI interactions

## 📐 Site Structure

- **Home**: Hero banner + tagline. Immediate identity.
- **Projects**: Dev cards, GitHub links, code snippets, "why it matters" blurbs.
- **Music & Media**: Session work, gear lists, embedded audio, studio/live rigs.
- **Services**: Dev/audio/consulting options with clear pricing and mission-form-style requests.
- **Store**: Merch hooks (coming later).
- **About**: Full story in timeline format — raw, real, clean.
- **Contact**: No BS. No “inquire here.” Just, “Let’s fix it.”

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ w/ App Router
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
- **Fonts**: Rajdhani, Inter, Roboto Mono
- **Icons**: Lucide
- **Email**: Resend or Formspree (or custom SMTP)
- **Deploy**: Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
